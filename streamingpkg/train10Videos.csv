1,1,"[, Music, ], [ Applause, ], [, Music, ], [ Applause, ] FinTech discussion for this week is called financial technological"
2,1," Until the conversations we sided on Monday, we're gon na continue all through till next week"
3,1," So, let's bring in Aditi JLS show who is the managing partner at Sahab growth Africa to wrap up the program for a la 5 minutes with us today is good to have you good to be here"
4,1," This is about innovation and on your side, of the entire new thinking that we have in Nigeria and - and you guys are coming together to form something that banks technology companies, whatever even the government - can meet to be part of it"
5,1," So it's also on the innovation side of it, so it the innovation in terms of FinTech, you know, has to do with how to make financial services better"
6,1," Traditionally, FinTech was always about the back office of banks, a boy in in recent times"
7,1," We'Ve seen how you know innovators are coming and bringing technology into the space of financial services to make it more efficient, to make it cheaper to transact services and to make these financial services available to a larger audience"
8,1, As we know in the world there's to millions of people who don't have access to financial services
9,1,", so you find the innovation that is in many ways changing the way"
10,1," The conversation goes between financial services, players and the market and consumers"
11,1," So what do you see? This are you: do bring in innovation, on the side of capital, you bring in innovation in terms of brick and mortar technology, so energy innovation is a cross sport in capital, how people access capital, unable to then deploy that capital in creating services"
12,1, We also seen a lot of innovation in terms of brick and motar 20 years ago
13,1," Our branches were standard, we tell us, you know, and you have to walk in, but now we're having"
14,1," You know: branchless banking, we're having banking, where it's full of just ATMs"
15,1, We having banks and banking channels that you can deposit money so we're seeing that right across you seen
16,1," Innovations in even the way money's transferred are moved from one place to another, how people are able to pay for goods and services, and these are things that we struggled with"
17,1," You know 10, 15, 20 years ago, who has seen a lot more as the world is coming together as a global village"
18,1," As we say, we are seeing that breaking down borders and because we know payment permeates every single thing"
19,1," We do whether its food, whether it's housing, whether it's you know you know clothes and things, then it's important to have those innovations happen to improve transactions"
20,1, Those of us who are a little bit old school and a little bit wary of technology
21,0," I don't want to lose my money, so security, so for you, FinTech professionals, my key concern as an individual will be our safety of my password, my pin world, whatever a PIN number as and all those things that the security of the network I'm using, for example, To make transfers or to do whatever, yes, I mean very important, more important conversation"
22,1," Oh yeah! Definitely definitely you know what we need to see in renowned environments, the application of world standard security protocols to ensure that whilst those transactions are happening at those payments are happening, it's very secure"
23,1," Of course, we know that nothing is 100 % secure, but in as much as you know their protocols and that lots of innovations happening in that space"
24,1, What we need to do locally is to ensure that we applying those security protocols to ensure that there's a lot of confidence
25,1," Of course, this is a game where regulation comes in where regulation is in at par, or you know, in line with global best practices, then as a consumer as an end-user, an individual, then I'm more at home or attuned to trying out these new technologies, because I Know that this is what applies globally, but we've left the age where we can sit here and think that we're not connected we are connected"
26,1, So the important is to ensure that security protocols are adopted globally and innovations continue in that space to ensure that things get a lot more secure encryption
27,1," You know, SSL Security's, you know certificates as long as those are in play"
28,1," The mag gives the confidence with a lot of Education on the consumer side to be comforting to me, because folk says: well, I didn't make a transaction, but I just found out on my bank account that some money just disappeared and then the bank says come to The come tomorrow, one day, one week, two weeks, three weeks so far, four weeks to 30 days a month and and it's a trying to resolve it and said well what happen I'm sure this has some all the issues"
29,1, I want you professionals to give me some
30,1, Some some comforted solutions to in the days and weeks ahead
31,1," Thank you very much for being part of the program, thank all of the FinTech, a professional or the young and innovative guys here"
32,1, I'M also trying to be one of them I'll come back tomorrow and see if we can put something very nice and professional together and very interesting and innovative as well
33,1," We have 24 hours enjoy the rest of your day and I leave you in the hands of our news team, [, Music, ] "
34,1,Very much Ian and thank you all for joining today
35,1, I'Ve been teaching every year at at Melbourne Law School
36,1," I think for about eight years now - and I always enjoy the time that I have sometimes it's shorter than I would like, but inevitably I chanced to meet up with old friends and and collaborators so as special thanks to the loft school, the program and the Center For co-hosting this seminar today today, I'm talking about FinTech and we think about the past year or so"
37,0," Technology technology, like technological developments in finance and risks raised by technology in the financial sector, have been amongst the leading news stories, certainly over the past year"
38,1," I think, for the first time in the past eight years or so, there have been more stories about FinTech issues than there have been about financial crises issues and that high is a very positive change"
39,1," In my view, when we're talking about financial technology, we're talking about fed in tech, there tend to be three different strands of developments that are taking place all more or less"
40,1, At the same time
41,1," The first comes from over the past several years, particularly in the wake of the global financial crisis"
42,1, There has been an explosion in the number of small startups
43,1," Small firms often started by either people with technology backgrounds or financial sector backgrounds that are looking at new ways of doing things in the financial sector, with technology and certainly over the past couple of years"
44,1," This has been one of the major and most exciting developments, but at the same time there's another trend that dates back almost ten years now, and that is in the context of what is often called digital financial services"
45,1," This is the element where we are looking at use of technology, particularly in the context of financial inclusion and development in the context of developing countries, and much of this has been focused on mobile technology, mobile payments and development, such as in Pisa in Kenya"
46,1," But there's also a third strand to this area of FinTech of technology in the financial services sector, and that is a longer-term development, in particular in the international wholesale markets"
47,1, We look at this
48,1, There are two main strands where we've seen the most significant development
49,1," The first is in the context of payment systems, electronic payment systems like Swift systems like CLS all culminating in today's five and a half trillion dollar global foreign exchange markets"
50,1," The other aspect of this has been in the securities markets really dating back to the launch of Nasdaq as first electronic exchange, but very much Hulman aiding in today's high frequency and algorithmic trading, and this paper, which was part of a project jointly between myself, hi Janos, Barbarous and ross buckley first one paper that basically looks at the evolution of technology in the financial sector and at the moment and i'll, be speaking about this as well"
51,0," We'Re working on a second which is really looking at some of the issues of technology in regulation, and i think what is interesting is if we look at the global FinTech environment today"
52,1, It is really about these three different strands coming together and i think the key thing that we are seeing that is changing has to do with the question of who is applying technology in the financial sector
53,1," In other words, it is not just from the standpoint of traditional financial institutions, though, as it happens, traditional financial institutions remain one of the largest spenders on i"
54,1,"t globally spending in the neighborhood of about two hundred billion dollars a year on technology, and this is a trend That looks said if anything as a result of new competition to increase"
55,1," In addition, we are seeing an increasing number of large IT companies involved larger IT companies involved not only from the staff point of providing system, services and backups to traditional financial institutions, but IT companies"
56,1," Looking increasingly to compete directly with financial institutions via technology and perhaps the highest profile example of this comes from China in particular, Alibaba an e-commerce company which has become one of the most significant players in the Chinese financial services sector"
57,1," And finally, the new startups startups, which are either coming from people with tech backgrounds, but just as frequently coming from people with financial services backgrounds"
58,1, It'S interesting
59,1, I remember before the 2008 global financial crisis
60,1," If you would talk to someone who had just left an investment bank, invariably they had one of two plans: either they were going to open a hedge fund or they were going to open a restaurant"
61,1," Today, if you talk to someone who has left an investment bank most frequently they're starting a thin text that has very much replaced moving into fund management and the ones that are starting thin tech startups often have in mind starting the startup selling it to a bank"
62,1," In five years and then opening a restaurant, so things haven't changed that much the other aspect"
63,1," In addition to the who is the speed of development - and this poses a very particular challenge from the standpoint of regulation - and I think the example that we see most 20 in this context - is the launch by Alibaba of a money market mutual fund called you about That in ten months, went from nothing to almost a hundred billion dollars in assets"
64,1, It is now the world's fourth largest money market mutual fund
65,1, That is speed
66,1," Another aspect of speed which we have seen in the context of India, India, as a result of a variety of plans coming together on something that is increasingly called India stock, has successfully opened electronic accounts for a billion people in less than three years"
67,1," That is speed of development, and this combination of new players plus speed is having both a dramatic impact on financial services generally, but also closing very new challenges for regulators"
68,1," I think if we look at the evolution of Technology in the financial sector, this is actually something that finance and technology have always gone together and we actually mark the previous age of financial globalization at the end of the 19th century"
69,1," If we look at that first stage of financial globalization, what was it that brought together markets around the world? It was undersea Telegraph, cables, cables that made instantaneous communication first between New York and London and possible and, as cables were built between markets around the world, increasingly linked markets"
70,1," In this example, provided by the quote from Keynes, which highlights very much, I think the nature of globalization the same time, it's interesting to see last week, an announcement between Google and Facebook that they are putting in place a new transatlantic cable in order to support the Massive amounts of data that are being transferred across jurisdictions, so we can see very much this first stage of financial globalization, underpinned by technology as well"
71,1," And if we look at today's modern payment systems and even if we're looking at something like imp, ASA mobile payments based banking, very frequently, those mobile payment systems rest at their base on existing electronic payment systems established by central banks and banking systems and, of course, red Wire actually dates as a telegraphic money transfer system to 1918, but it's really the period in the aftermath of the Second World War, where we see the most important developments being laid across the Second World War"
72,1," Early development of computer technology, particularly in the context of code"
73,1," Breaking and we see in the aftermath of the Second World War, the increasing tech, increasing commercialization and development of that technology, we can see some early developments first, credit card 1950 telex, the predecessor of the fax machine, the predecessor, today's communication systems 1966"
74,1," But we actually mark 1967, the advent of the first ATM machine by Barclays, along with the first portable computer, the handheld calculator by Texas Instruments as the real mark of the digital transformation of financial services"
75,1, And I think that this quote from Paul Volcker
76,1," Sort of highlights that Volcker, of course, in this quote, is speaking in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and he has in mind innovations like CEOs and credit default swaps"
77,1," That, in his view, had marginal real value for the financial system"
78,1, But he is highlighting that the ATM that for him was the most important development in financial services of the past 20 years
79,1," We can see the basis of cross-border payment systems box chips to the late 1960s Swift, the basis of today's five trillion dollar a day"
80,1," Foreign exchange markets from 1973, and it is of course Swift and the bangladesh bank heist that has received some of the most headlines over the past couple of months and, of course, in some ways, the bangladesh bank ice brings together all of those different pieces"
81,0," When you have a group of hackers from we're not entirely sure where, at this point, hacking into the computer systems of the central bank of bangladesh, getting access to the swift payment system via the bangla centralized directing payments to be made from the bangladesh's central bank's accounts"
82,1," At the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to a large number of branches of different banks in the Philippines, where couriers are waiting to extract the cash and spirit it out of the country, it's a perfect movie"
83,1," If you think you couldn't come up with a better theme, but very much, this is highlighting vulnerabilities in the context of global payment system"
84,1," Swift links, 11,000 banks around the world via desktop access to and international payment system, and this is foundational to financial globalization"
85,1," As we know it, if we look at Nasdaq - and of course Nasdaq, as I mentioned, is the basis of today's high-frequency algorithmic trading, the stories of flash boards - and this is something that, if we think about it, dating back to 1987, 1987, almost 30 years after the 1987 market crash our best explanation, still of what happened is program 3"
86,1," What is program trading program trading is computerized, buy and sell orders that executed themselves automatically at preset price levels"
87,1," That indicates that by 1987, certainly in the wholesale securities markets, computerized trading already played a dominant role"
88,1," Of course, we see similar things today, most recently a flash crash in China's futures markets yesterday previous flash crashes in the United States and in other markets"
89,1," If we look at global security trading today, the vast majority of trading does not take place between human beings"
90,1," It takes place between computers, questions of fairness about setting hedge fund or trading servers next to the exchange server in order to get time and values"
91,1," If you spend some time today, talking to a hedge fund manager, the hedge fund managers life in some ways increasingly resembles something out of the matrix or the terminator"
92,1," In other words, the hedge fund manager knows that he or she is not trading with human beings"
93,1," That anytime, he or she undertakes any action in the markets"
94,1, That action will be immediately probed by a large number of different computerized systems
95,1," If we look at some of the most recent statistics in the United States, something like 90 % of buy and sell orders are cancelled before they're execute"
96,0, These are simply computerized programs that are directing trying to search out price directions
97,1," So I think that is an interesting angle and if we think of startups, we often think of FinTech startups as a new trend and certainly in terms of numbers"
98,1, It is but in many ways one can actually think of Bloomberg as one of the world's first fit intact startups
99,1, What was Bloomberg's background? He was in IT in Salomon Brothers
100,1, He was setting up computerized systems to support Salomon Brothers trading and risk management activities
101,1," He took those ideas established a startup firm with investment from Salomon Brothers, looking much like today's accelerators set up by financial institutions and certainly by the mid-1980s, we see Bloomberg terminals as a normal fixture on financial institution trading desks around the world and of course one cannot Ignore that, if Wilkes, if you look at the LIBOR or Forex scandals, much of the activity in the context of market collusion was taking place where, in Bloomberg, secure communications chat rooms"
102,1, The mobile phone of course comes out in the 1980s and this is not only the basis of digital financial services
103,1," Mobile payments in developing countries, but eventually of the smartphone, but somewhat amazing"
104,1," To think that next year, 2017 will only be the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, and in that less than 10 years, the smartphone in particular, has had an absolutely transformative impact on the way that we do almost everything, including financial services, online banking dates to the early 1980S by 2001, eight banks in the United States each have over a million online banking customers and, of course, if we think about technology in the context of risk management, the 1990s were really the and a value at risk models"
105,1, This was the period when investment banks began hiring very aggressively physics and computer science graduates in order to develop highly sophisticated risk management techniques
106,1, We suggest that in many ways the 2008 financial crisis was a break that 2008
107,1," The 2008 crisis has transformed this aspect of the WHO and the speed first from the standpoint of post crisis regulatory reforms, post crisis regulatory reforms have come at this from a number of different angles"
108,1," First is that each time a financial institution is faced with a new regulatory requirement, one of the first things that financial institution will do is develop an IT system to implement those requirements so direct-drive"
109,1," Second, we have seen financial institutions as a result of post crisis"
110,1," Regulatory reforms exiting a wide range of different lines of business, and this has led, in addition to exiting lines"
111,1," Business has also been a continual process of downsizing and job losses, and in many cases this has driven former investment and other financial sector staff to look for new opportunities, often by creating startups in areas which their former employers have decided to exit financing games"
112,1," The fact that we have had problems, in particular in most countries, with financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as issues not only in developing countries, but also in developed countries of financial inclusion and access to financial services"
113,1, Where we have had an increasing number of startups stepping into and of course one cannot ignore the fact of Technology
114,1," If we think of evolution, we can think of financial institutions, major spenders and in fact, if we look at the startup scene today, it is in fact the most frequent result for a successful FinTech startup to be acquired by a major financial institution"
115,1," The numbers of FinTech startups that become large, successful businesses stand alone, like Bloomberg, is, as with any other industry relatively small, but this is having a major transformative effect in a good way on traditional financial services firms"
116,1," After all, if we think of banks insurance companies, they have traditionally spent a lot of money on research, but this is research to support sales"
117,1," This is not research and development, about better provision of financial services and the competition from both IT"
118,1," Firms, as well as startups, is driving traditional financial services firms to look at their operations in an entirely different way"
119,1," It companies in some ways, if we think of IT companies the ultimate objective, is to achieve with financial services what Apple did to the music"
120,1," In other words, the view is that, if we're thinking about financials today, Financial Services is primarily management transmission analysis of data and in many ways it may well be the case that IT firms are actually better suited to this sort of business than financial services firms, and Certainly, if we look at the example of Alibaba in China, Alibaba has definitely had this sort of impact on the Chinese financial services system and finally, startups startups are a new area of competition that is impacting on both banks and IT companies"
121,1," And if we look at startups, it's important to realize that startups are not just focusing on things like customer interface or mobile payments, that many startups are looking at things like secure communications, cross-border payments, secured settlement, quantitative risk management, algorithmic trading"
122,1," So when we're thinking about startups startups are involved in technology in all aspects of the financial services sector, not just things like alternative financing, p2p and crowd foot"
123,1," So if we look at technology in the financial services sector today, you can see a number of different trends"
124,1, I think the key message is that this FinTech transformation process is impacting all areas of the financial sector
125,1," If we look at finance and investment, it is not just the advent of alternative mechanisms"
126,1," It'S not even just digitalization of financing things like high frequency and algorithmic trading, but going beyond that"
127,1, One of the most interesting developments is in the context of robo-advisor e-business
128,1," After all, if we think of some of the potential of technology, it is actually to better serve those that may not be served at all to them and we think of the traditional financial services industry for big firms"
129,1," It is increasingly the case that, in order to justify the costs of a human being, the amount of assets available to the investor have to be quite substantial"
130,1, Many firms are now putting a minimum of a million to two million in investable assets to actually access a human being in terms of financial advice
131,1, At the same time - and this of course has issues for for universities
132,1," But if we think of what outside of that range is available in terms of human financial advice, it may well be the case that a computerised asset allocation system recommending the lowest cost products to deliver the best balance in terms of allocation is actually going to be More beneficial to most people than the advice that they might receive from a human financial services invention and at the same time, when we are talking about investment amounts that are relatively small a few dollars"
133,1, The costs involved means that technology is in many ways
134,1," The only approach it's interesting to see in this context than amongst Goldman Sachs's, most recent purchases, an online bank to access deposits, all over United States and a robo advisory for the view being from the standpoint of Goldman Sachs, that they should be able to use fewer People to access far larger amounts of money via technology, and that raises a range of interesting questions, operations and risk management"
135,1," Not only our financial institutions are ready, huge spenders in the context of IT, but as a result of competition, we are seeing increased spending from financial institutions, and this is an area"
136,1," If we look at Asia, Pacific asia-pacific financial institutions have traditionally spent far less on IT than financial institutions from the United States and Europe, which means that, even in the context of traditional financial services, better using IT to manage their own operations and risks, there are massive Opportunities in this region, payments and infrastructure - I've mentioned already electronic payment systems such as Swift"
137,1," But of course, the new developments were seeing we're seeing things such as the investigation by Swift of the use of blockade trading technology for payments, we're seeing from ASX here in Australia from NASDAQ OMX investigations about using blockchain in the context of custody settlement clearing of securities"
138,1," So very much if you think about it, a little bit from the standpoint of things such as OTC derivatives settlement"
139,1, Things like blockchain actually are an approach that hadn't been available and widely understood amongst regulators
140,1, Eight years ago may have provided a much better solution than the solution which have in fact been adopted: data security and monetization
141,1," I think there are two sides of this and of course, many of us are familiar that a large number of phantoms are based upon analysis of data, in particular looking for new ways of determining creditworthiness or pricing, financial services to consumers"
142,1," Large numbers of thin texts that have come up with some sort of correlation between likelihood of repayment and therefore ability to borrow now one of the questions about this is how many of these will perform in the context of a downturn, and that is very much an Open question but at the same time, this idea of data place"
143,1," If we look at our lembaga in China, Alibaba thinks of itself primarily as a data company"
144,1, It is collecting massive volumes of data on everything
145,1," It is then, using that data analyzing patterns to be able to make judgments from things like restaurant and hotel reservation cubes to things like trade financing to things like investments, that is using data in a different way than traditional financial services"
146,1, Firms have - and this is one of the core changes taking place in the post-crisis environment
147,1," At the same time, traditional financial institutions have massive amounts of data built up over long periods of time, but traditionally they're actually very poor at using it, and that is something that we're seeing"
148,1, An increasing number of startups working on is mechanisms to analyze and monetize
149,0," Not just other data but data by financial institutions themselves, but of course all of this raises increasing security concerns and the bangladesh bank heist is only the most high-profile recent example of that"
150,0," Certainly in the United States, financial services is now viewed as a national security issue"
151,1," That means that, certainly, from the standpoint of those of you involved in compliance you've seen over the past year and a half and ever-increasing volume of new rules and regulations dealing with effectively cyber security in financial service, and this, of course, if we think about the financial Sector, this is one of the biggest risks going forward"
152,1," After all, financial services today is almost entirely a digital industry"
153,1," The thing about, often the only time for most of us, at which point Finance ceases to be digital and becomes a physical transaction, is when we pull cash out of the ATM machine"
154,1," Prior to that, every aspect has been digitized in some ways"
155,1, It'S good news that large financial institute IT systems are such a mess
156,1," Why are they such a mess? Because very often large financial institutions grew by way of acquisition each time you acquired another firm, you simply bolted on the IT systems of that firm"
157,1," What that means is that for most large financial institutions today, not only do they not have integrated systems, in fact, they very often have conflicting systems that cannot communicate with one another"
158,1, That means that it's impossible to access and analyze the vast amounts of data that they might have
159,1," But it also means that from the standpoint of cybersecurity, because they have so many different in communicable systems internally, that they are less vulnerable to disruption, but as they integrated systems, which is for many major financial institutions, a headline objective over the next couple of years"
160,1," That will change, and certainly as we've seen with the Bangladesh Swift example, even systems like Swift, which we've come to rely on every day"
161,0," Even institutions like central banks, like the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, are not only increasingly subjected to attacks but are increasingly vulnerable to disruption from those and finally, the customer interface, the interaction between the smartphone and other devices with the consumer"
162,0," And we would suggest that all of these together raise issues that suggest that not only do regulators have to gain a better understanding of these techno logical, evolutionary trends in the financial sector, but that in fact, regulators need to be using technology far better in their own Operations, we look at the context of China, in particular as an interesting example, and what we're seeing is that, in the context of developing countries with high smartphone penetration rates and a generally inefficient existing financial system, that there is potential for quite high levels of disruption"
163,1," As a result of technological developments, this sorts of challenges and disruptions are more difficult in the context of developed countries, which already have relatively effective financial systems"
164,1," But China in particular, provides a good example of IT"
165,1, Firms outflanking traditional financial services firms because of the existing inefficiencies and problems in those traditional firms and in many ways becoming more important from the standpoint of the day-to-day lives of the largest number of people than traditional facts regulation to think about regulation
166,1," I'Ve Illustrated this previously, but one of the biggest challenges for regulators, this combination of new entrants and speed of development"
167,1, The fact that something can go from what we call too small to care to too big to fail in record time
168,1," Certainly, one can think of the example of Kenya that in pace at the mobile phone-based pain system now deals with something like 60 % of payments in the Kenyan economy"
169,1, That means that that has become a core infrastructure underlying the economy
170,1," It'S interesting Gates, Foundation last year, did an analysis of a number of these mobile based payment systems in developing countries and, in fact found that some of them have quite good security, including a pacer, but some of them actually have very poor security, which actually means that The level of risk inherent in the development of these alternatives may be just as high as the benefits that are being achieved"
171,0," This context of Pugh and speed is one a challenge for regulators, particularly large countries"
172,1," China provides an example whereby we can see that something can develop very rapidly to a very significant size before regulators even become aware of, and certainly this is one reason why China has more peer-to-peer lending platforms over 2000 than the rest of the world combined"
173,1," It'S also one of the reasons why, amongst these alternative financing vehicles in China, we've also seen some of the worst examples of fraud"
174,1," A firm that failed in beginning of this year had gone in a period of 18 months from nothing to 900,000 customers"
175,1, At the time it failed
176,1, The losses were approximately 5 billion u
177,1,s
178,1, dollars
179,1," What was the structure? A classic Ponzi scheme, in other words, money being taken from new customers and you to pay interest and returns to existing customers"
180,1," How did they grown so rapidly? Well, in fact, they had advertised on China state television, it's actually open to anybody, but by advertising on CCTV"
181,1," The implication was that the firm was somehow tied to the state and therefore safer, and this is the sort of concern not only from the standpoint of regulators but also from the standpoint of participants in the industry"
182,1," Initially in the Bitcoin example comes to mind like uber and, like a number of other examples, initial entrance often had in mind disrupting existing patterns often developed to avoid regulatory systems, but we're increasingly finding that startups in particular, would like to have licensing and registration"
183,1, Two reasons for that one: it provides some evidence that this is a valid business which is actually good from the standpoint of the start-up
184,1," Second, if we think of one of the greatest risks to new startup firms, it is a major froth"
185,0," In other words, if we were to see in a major market a major case of a start-up evolving into large losses amongst large numbers of customers, that could fundamentally impact on trust and confidence in the ability of startups to effectively match risk going forward and kill the Industry before it really has the chance to transform, we look at reg tech"
186,1," Red tech is about both dealing with regulation through technology, as well as, in particular regulators using technology"
187,1, Let me give you a couple of sides of this
188,1," I'Ve mentioned the fact that, in the context of traditional financial services firms, regulatory changes will invariably drive development of IT systems, but, let's think about in the context of the aftermath of the global financial crisis, large numbers of new reporting obligations, probably the biggest reporting obligation faced By any financial firm, whether or not it's established or startup is issues relating to know your customer, in particular money laundering and terrorist financing questions"
189,1," Now we certainly have reports in the context of Europe of warehouses, full of paper reports of suspicious transactions to regulators"
190,0," Regulators are buried in reports from financial institutions and much of that reporting ends up being used only after the fact something happens, and then you go dig through all of the reports to try to figure out what happened and who to pursue"
191,0," But from the standpoint of the regulatory system, it would be far better if you had a system which would analyze patterns as they developed in order to be able to highlight problems before they emerge"
192,1," Likewise, from the standpoint, this is one of the biggest cost problems"
193,0," How do you deal with customer acquisition and in many jurisdictions at some point, the customer is still going to have to physically turn up, show their physical ID and sign some visible forms"
194,0," That is something that not only is ineffective from the standpoint of the regulatory system, but it is a major barrier to the development of new entrants"
195,1," New approaches to this, and we see an interesting example of the use of technology to deal with some of these issues"
196,1," In the context of India, I mentioned the opening of over a billion accounts"
197,1," You combine that with biometric IDs and the fact that, once your ID has been matched to your account that that provides the essential mechanism to support, know your customer by other financial firms"
198,1," That, then, not only makes the process of customer acquisition easier for traditional firms, but it also opens it up to new interests, and that is one way in which we can see governments and regulators seeking to support mechanisms which will not impede the market but actually make Things work better"
199,1, Another example think about regulators use of data
200,1," This is not something new, we think to the United States, at least since the late 1980s"
201,1, The largest percentage of insider dealing in the United States have not come from tips or reports
202,1," They'Ve come from analysis of stock exchange trading records, in other words, if a merger is announced on this date at this time, all you have to do is analyze the previous couple of months of trading activity to see if there are any unusual spikes in purchasers or Sales of those shares - and that is how most insider dealing convictions in the United States are actually achieved"
203,1," Now, of course, in the context of high-frequency trading, one of the biggest challenges for the SEC today is that most trading doesn't take place on the exchange, and so we actually have an ongoing initiative where the SEC is now requiring not only reporting of all trading information"
204,1," On the exchange, but also all trading off the exchange, so that, then, you will be able to see in the same way for a dark pool or NECN"
205,1," If there was a spike in unusual activity before a material event took place, and that highlights it in the context of regulation, there is massive opportunity, particularly for regulators in developing countries, to use technology to enhance their own regulation, to support market development and also to enhance Financial stability, if we think of this region, one of the biggest challenges is that this region, unlike the US or Europe, is highly frightened"
206,0," This means that it is a real challenge to develop technology, which is usable across multiple jurisdictions and, after all, when we think of some of the ideas of democratization of Finance, many of those ideas are based on the idea that an electronic system should be able to Access customers anywhere and everywhere at all times, but the fact is that regulatory barriers make that impossible, not only in this region but actually in most regions of the world"
207,1, Europe
208,1," We at least have discussions, the united states, federal legislation and the context of the JOBS Act and others seeking approaches to deal with it"
209,1, But it is very much a problem in th
210,1,"Hello, everyone and welcome to this Bob scard webinar, I'm Nicole, miss Kelly, you're Bob Scott moderator today"
211,1, The subject for today's webinar is hot topics in fin tech law and we'll be looking at various key areas of financial technology law
212,1," From the viewpoint of banking, securities, insurance and payment cards, we will also be addressing topics such as cyber security, information, governance, mobile banking and cloud computing in order to gain a deeper understanding of these topics, as they relate to the use of technology in the highly regulated Financial services industry"
213,1," Finally, while largely a us focused webinar, the presentation will also address global issues and viewpoints so to introduce our speaker will be hearing shortly from Kevin Taylor partner at Schneider"
214,1," Harrison Siegel a Lewis, LLP Kevin is a highly regarded technology, outsourcing, an intellectual property attorney"
215,1," He has global experience with BPO and IT outsourcing technology, licensing, commercialization of intellectual property, complex commercial contracts, privacy and more"
216,1, It'S also appeared on Bloomberg Television
217,1, It'S been quoted in The Wall Street Journal
218,1," He is also the author of FinTech law, a guide to technology law in the financial services industry published by Bloomberg and BNA, but before we hear from Kevin there are a few housekeeping points to take note of"
219,1," If you have a question to ask our speaker, please go to the Box on your screen and simply type it in I'll use at the end of the hour-long webinar today time permitting, the entire webinar will also be recorded"
220,1," So if you miss anything or think a colleague would be interested later on, you'll be sent a link to the recording without further ado I'll hand over to our expert speaker today Kevin over to you"
221,1, Thank you very much
222,1, I first just want to say I'm very happy and excited to be able to speak with everybody today and talk about FinTech laws
223,1, It'S an area that I get very
224,1, They get very excited about it
225,1, There'S a lot going on
226,1, There'S been a lot going on and they'll be even more going on in in the future
227,1," I'Ve represented a lot of large financial institutions in the development and purchase of technology, but I've also represented smaller companies that sell to those larger institutions and I've seen a lot of different things over the years and finally, last year I decided to sit down and actually Write a book on it FinTech law, which, as was mentioned, you know it's published by Bloomberg BNA, but this is really just the start of it, because this area is changing so much now today, we're going to I'm going to talk and give you an overview of Certain areas, certain parts of this and I'm going to focus on mobile financial services, cloud computing information, governance, which actually has several different sub parts and then, lastly, I'm going to talk about cyber security, which is a big issue and really affects all of these other areas"
228,1," As well so what do we mean when we say mobile financial services? Well, I define it as any financial activity using any mobile device, such as a cell phone or a tablet or whatever device is invented in the future, because I'm sure someone will come up with something else and it allows bank customers to obtain account information to transfer Funds and even sometimes pay bills"
229,1, It'S estimated that mobile phones will be the payment method of choice for over 50 million consumers worldwide the market
230,1," In 2011, the market was 11 and a half billion dollars"
231,1, This is expected to grow
232,1," The main technology that's used currently is FC technology, near-field communications, which we'll talk about in a minute, but there are other technologies as well now, initially, to give you a little history"
233,1," Payments in mobile phones were made through text messaging, but this would sometimes be slow and unreliable and hence could not be relied upon for making larger payments"
234,1, This led to the development of near-field communications
235,1," There we go okay, so NFC technology has enabled the exchange of data between advices using existing infrastructure, which was already in place for payments"
236,1," It can also work when the devices are turned off, which is similar to a credit card right that you don't need power in order to make the payment"
237,1, It has a very short range about four inches
238,1," He uses a iso/iec 1 for 43 standard, which is a for proximity cards, contactless cards and also RFID, and it really kind of combines the interface of a smart card and a reader into a single device"
239,1, It'S currently aimed at being used with mobile phones
240,1," It'S used for card emulation, simulates a smart card"
241,1," It can be used as a reader and read passive, RFID tags, and it also communicates directly with another NFC device so that they're, exchanging information current uses include electronic ticketing, electronic money, travel cards, identity documents, mobile commerce, paying for your Starbucks or your new blue jeans"
242,1," They can also be used for electronic keys, your car key, your house key hotel room and it can be used to configure other wireless devices or other wireless connections such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or ultra wideband, there's, currently a patent licensing program by via licensing corporation"
243,1," If you want to use NFC in a device or in software, it's good to go there and check out the different licensing options"
244,1," There'S a public platform for NFC, that's released under the GNU open-source license"
245,1, It'S called Li B at FC org now NFC is when I compare it
246,1," Some other another technology was out there, which is Bluetooth right"
247,1," Afc is is finding strength in the marketplace because of it has certain advantages over Bluetooth as a shorter set-up time, it's easier to configure the transfer data transfer rate is slower, but there's in payments is very little data that needs to be transferred to certain data points That need to go, but it's that you're not transferring data"
248,1, It takes as much data to transfer $ 1 as it takes to transfer $ 100
249,1," Nfc has a shorter range than Bluetooth, which makes it a little more secure"
250,1," It'S suitable for crowded areas where getting a right signal for the right device can sometimes be difficult, and it's consistent with RFID, which means you don't always need the battery"
251,1, As we mentioned it can be used when the device is turned off
252,0," Now there are some drawbacks: NFC can be hacked, it offers no protection against eavesdropping, that it can be vulnerable to data modifications and there can be other attacks as well"
253,1, The the RF signal for the wireless data transfer can be picked up with antennas and it's able Packers are able to eavesdrop from various distances
254,0," So it's not always easy to tell if your mobile phone is being hacked, there's no written another way it can be hacked"
255,0," Is data can be destroyed and modified, so really is there's no and there's a really no way to prevent that attack"
256,1," You can check and use NFC to check the field while they're sending it, but that might might detect it"
257,1, It might not
258,0," Now, what's the a concern is that there might be data seft, there might be dealing of money in this case right so as a market for mobile financial services has developed and grown the protection of consumer financial information and from unauthorized access should be of prime importance Right, we need to know how to authenticate the consumers identification to keep the data transfer process safe from viruses and malware, and these other attacks and it's important to have a wholesale approach"
259,0, So this is covered throughout the entire process and generally information held by banks and other server service and provide service providers is very important and there's a risk there of leakage through hacking tampering unauthorized access
260,1," So we need to make sure, there's adequate measures and safeguards for consumer data protection"
261,1, Now in the United States there are regulatory measures in place
262,1, The first one is called gramm-leach-bliley
263,1, This is our the u
264,1,s
265,1, privacy law
266,1," I know in Europe there's a much better privacy law, but you know for, as we said, this is it's geared toward the US market or we'll touch on some other areas as well, but under gramm-leach-bliley, as with any privacy law, it's important to protect the consumers non-public Personal information which under gramm-leach-bliley is information provided to a financial institution by a consumer, something that results from a transaction or service from the consumers or something like a credit card transaction you're buying that cup of coffee you're buying your your new watch or whatever or it's Other information somehow obtained by the financial institution, this information, it can include loan terms lender or mortgage broker names, sales amounts and sales concessions, co-borrower information, unpublished, phone numbers and other contact information, and anything really that it's that would be sensitive to an individual consumer"
267,1," Even the fact that a particular consumer is engaged with a particular lender is considered to be protected information if has not been recorded publicly or disclosed in some other way, if there's a breach of data security with respect to private information by any entity to whom GLB Applies then, that entity would be liable for that breach"
268,1," Now we're going to talk about data liability a little later, we're going to talk about the target breach and some of these other breaches in more detail, but generally gramm-leach-bliley applies to any financial institution or any really any vendor or subcontractor of a financial institution or anyone"
269,1," That'S that's making use of this information, so it can also apply to merchants to credit card processors"
270,1," People like that, it's a fairly broad interpretation"
271,1," It can apply to insurance brokers, security firms, tax preparers, real estate settlement companies, etc"
272,1," Now, with respect to mobile financial services, there's a question as to whether it applies to mobile carriers like Sprint or t-mobile or Verizon, and a lot of times you can buy things directly and have it charged to your to your mobile bill"
273,1," That'S that's another type of mobile financial services that the nd, the carriers have their own system they're trying to develop"
274,1," But it seems like this, the NFC things like Google and Apple I pay and those those kind of technologies I think, are going to gain ground and gain more traction with consumers and prop overtake the carrier"
275,1, Efforts in this area there's another regulatory factor to consider
276,1," Okay, this is the sarbanes sarbanes-oxley"
277,1," Excuse me: sardines, Oxley, act, hard hard to pronounce"
278,1," This applies really applies to public companies, any public company in the US, but they operate overseas as well"
279,1," It requires them to have accurate financial information, and it also requires any orders and subcontractors downstream that contribute to that financial information to to ensure that their technology systems and their internal controls are in in prepared and made in such a way that that information ends up Being accurate, it's about you know giving investors correct information now"
280,1, The way this ties in is it's logical to assume that any data theft or unauthorized access of data might be minimal in terms of gramm-leach-bliley
281,1," It may not impact gramm-leach-bliley, but it may impact sarbanes-oxley if it affects the financial condition of a company and that's actually"
282,1, This is actually a bigger target for hackers
283,1," You know hackers that may not be interested in your $ 5 coffee purchase, but they might be interested in"
284,1, They would be interested in
285,1, You know JP Morgan's reporting information or their financial statements
286,1, Non-Compliance with these provisions can lead to hefty fines being imposed on the institutions and entities involved
287,1," Now, there's some other our regulatory measures, but I want to just touch on and also come into play for mobile financial services"
288,1," There are FTC regulations which govern how you deal with customers, consumers and they apply to anyone, but they especially apply to banks in dealing with consumers, and it involves disclosure, proper disclosure to customers and not doing anything"
289,1," That'S misleading and advertising things like that, and this all takes"
290,1," These are laws that were in effect before mobile technology existed, but they still apply, they've been deemed to apply and common sense tells you even though you're doing something differently"
291,1, This is still going to apply as long as you're feeding information to consumers
292,1, There are also some state data breach disclosure laws
293,1," Here in the United States, we have over 40 different data, breach disclosure laws that all have different requirements"
294,1," There'S some movement toward having a federal data, breach disclosure law I'll talk about a little later, but right now it's really sort of this fractured structure and then, in terms of financial services, the certainly anyone that uses a credit card or payment card is going to be Subject to compliance with the PCI data standards and they actually need to be compliance really before you start using them"
295,1," If, if you're not compliant, it cannot only lead to PCI fines, but it can lead to liability in the courts"
296,1," The courts will say: hey you didn't even bother to comply with PCI you're, certainly guilty"
297,1," So it's this almost presumption of guilt if you're, not in compliance"
298,1," So the real question here is: what's the liability to banks and and their vendors, their subcontractors right? Is the bank service provider? How would they be held liable for these tampering of information, even though they're in compliance they're in compliance with pieces, either in compliance with GLB that they've done everything they're legally required to do? Would they still be liable, and it really seems that the law is not clear in this respect? Customers still might have recourse against these entities for traditional claims of negligence, breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty, but it's not clear"
299,1, There'S no clear-cut provision for holding an entity liable for loss of data due to acts like hacking
300,1," There'S there plenty of instances targeted, they just announced the settlement the other day"
301,1, There'S there's other plenty of cases
302,1," These big high-profile cases, people are going to sue and they have claims, but it's not clear how legitimate those claims are or or how much the banks, so the financial institution is going to be liable for the problem is it's it's just scary, because it isn't unknown And you never know if you're going to get the court that some courts, you know or juries my favor higher awards than others"
303,1," However, there is an increasing view that the laws in general should be rewritten to assign greater responsibility to service providers and other organizations that handle large amounts of personal information"
304,1," Like a cloud service provider, let's say, and the view is that such organizations should be legally required to inform their customers as soon as there's a hack or any data loss or any data penetration really and that they should be held legally liable for the financial impact"
305,1," On their customers as a result of hacking and identity theft, there are laws in Congress nothing's on the books, but there our draft laws that are being circulated to this effect to impose this higher standard on these companies"
306,1," So, just to summarize and conclude this section on mobile financial services, clearly the matter transactions are going to increase"
307,1, There are regulatory constraints that impose these conditions
308,1, It'S it's likely
309,1," Those regulatory constraints will increase and, as the number of users increase, there's going to be, it's a greater challenge to the marketplace and the regulators and and really service providers and technology people in the industry"
310,1," To handle this, I mean people want to be able to make payments through their mobile phones"
311,1," It'S something people are willing to provide, but how can you do it in a safe way and I don't think that people should be able to company should be able to handle someone else's money without being regulated or having some kind of oversight"
312,1," But at the same time, that oversight can't be so strict that it doesn't make business sense for that transaction to take place"
313,1," Okay, move on to our next section cloud computing in keeping"
314,1," Even I am a time I want to talk about the risks of cloud computing, we'll talk about some of the legal and regulatory issues again, we'll talk about briefly talk about negotiation issues and contracting objectives with the last two typically in cloud computing"
315,1," It'S not always easy to negotiate, there's often very little to negotiate unless you're a big player a big fortune, 500 companies, don't they rarely sign the standard cloud computing contractors"
316,1, There'S definitely
317,1," I know plenty of instances of some heavy negotiation, but for most businesses the contract is pretty much, take it or leave it"
318,1," However, when constructing those contracts and making those service offerings, I think the cloud providers need to take into account some of these legal and regulatory issues, because they're going to be held accountable down the road and, if there's a regulatory requirement, even if the contract says otherwise, The cloud computing vendor is is going to be held liable in the next slide"
319,1, This is one of my favorite slides
320,1, It'S a great picture
321,1, You know we now live in a cloudy world right
322,1," We have these these network clouds, and this is this - is actually an old diagram that I modified from in the late"
323,1, It was 1998 1999
324,1," We did a lot of network outsourcing, and this was how we sort of describe the clouds well"
325,1, This is now evolved
326,1, Cloud grew out of network outsourcing and it's still at its most basic level
327,1," That'S what it is, but but there are these clouds right"
328,1, This is a large multinational
329,1, Companies will have data centers kind of along these lines
330,1, They certainly be one for Europe
331,1," This data requirements and other things in Europe that are common, so it's easy, have one data center for Europe, a data center for North America, data center for Asia, Pacific and then Latin America as well"
332,1," So we we just live in a world, that's segregated! In that way - and I think it's it's good to know - and it's good to set your business model so that you're, maybe attacking or addressing one markets needs at time at a time, so I just want to go"
333,1," I want to move a little quicker here, so cloud computing"
334,1," You know there's a definition here, but it's really a shared pool of configurable computing resources right, whether it's a network, a server software applications or literally services, but the services are usually provided by means of some type of software and it's broken down into three large categories"
335,1, Here so the first is infrastructure as a service
336,1," So that's you know: you're getting X, server capacity and Y latency, etc"
337,1," The next is platform as a service, so maybe you're getting some hearing, availability to hardware and you're getting a basic platform, some middleware in which to run your applications and the last is sass"
338,1," What used to be called application, service, provider or ASP is where you're really sort of making use of some software? It'S not on your service on someone else's server, but you don't see any of that"
339,1, You don't know
340,1," What'S going on there, you're really just using the software that whatever functionality, whatever business model, you've chosen to accept cloud computing, can be used a lot of ways"
341,1, It can be
342,1, The traditional Service Bureau set up where maybe you're buying payroll services and you it's just a website and you're putting information you're receiving information
343,1," It could be information technology outsourcing, so it's more like the platform as a service or the infrastructure as a service, or there might be some technology heavy business process which is useful to outsource, and this happens a lot in financial services where there's credit-card processing"
344,1," As an example of something like that, where there's a lot of technology that happens behind the screen, no one really wants to know the details"
345,1, I just want to know that it's done correctly and you know certain restrictions in place
346,1," Well, why don't? Why do people outsource to the cloud? The first might be financial motivation? Maybe it's cheaper makes sense financially"
347,1," It might also mean it's easier to identify the costs and segregate those cost and and understand, predict whether you're going to save money or not"
348,1, You can certainly access more infrastructure at a lower cost and often software at a lower cost
349,1," It allows management to focus on the core competencies of the company, whether it's in financial services, whether it's some type of investment management or, as I said, credit some something in the credit card, world marketing credit cards or selling insurance, or anything like that"
350,1," Typically, cloud computing has there's a significant resource commitment in the cloud right once these clouds are built"
351,1," They stay in place for the for the customer, there's a fixed contract term and the contract terms themselves"
352,1, They can either be simple or complex
353,1, I think it depends on the business relationship and really the leverage that the customer has
354,1," As I said, for large multinational companies, they typically rarely sign a standard cloud contract without some negotiation for smaller companies"
355,1," They just don't have the leverage, so they they adopt"
356,1," Whatever the cloud vendor is providing the market for these services - and the pricing, I think, is still in flux"
357,1, There'S a lot of competition out there there's a lot of different service offerings and I think it's important to do research when contemplating any sort of cloud computing usage any use of cloud computing
358,0, So what are the risks of cloud computing be? Certainly there can be security breaches that the cloud service provider doesn't discover
359,0," Data can be in jurisdictions without adequate data protection, as we as we serve as these different clouds around the world"
360,1," Typically, Europe has a European data center"
361,1, Everyone knows Europe has great privacy laws
362,1," Let'S, let's put all our data over there, you know and segregated that's one way to ensure that your data is protected"
363,0," But the question is: are you asking your cloud service provider? Hey? Are you? Are you putting this in the right place? Oh you're protecting it directly because the regulations that we talked about earlier, the privacy regulations, etc"
364,0, The regulators don't care
365,1," If, if a bank hires a service provider and the service provider makes a mistake, the bank is still going to be held accountable"
366,1," There you're not going to be able to shift liability and just say: oh, I didn't do it, my service provider did"
367,1," They are going to hold the bank liable for that and and typically, as we kind of touched upon these, these cloud computing vendors"
368,1, The providers have a lot of discretion in their terms and conditions a lot of times it's boilerplate contracts
369,1," So maybe you can't get something in the contract, but you still need to ask the question a what you know"
370,1," Where is my data? Is it protected, etc? Some other risks involve service providers using data for their own purposes right sometimes so"
371,1, They'Ll do data mining or they'll
372,1," Well, they typically like to aggregate data and find trends and and use that information for other purposes"
373,1," As a customer, I think you have to question whether you want someone else learning things about your business and then going out and making use of it and again I think it's important to have it comes down to the contracting"
374,1," There needs to be accountability and responsibility with the subcontractors, the cloud provider that you're contracting with may have its own subcontractors people"
375,1, You don't even see again people behind the screen
376,1," It'S important to ask who are those people are they accountable? Can I rely on them? Other risks involved, you're really losing control of your data"
377,0," Are you keeping backups? Is the cloud provider keeping backups how difficult it is it to get to that data? If you need it, another risk you're sharing the infrastructure with who knows you could be sharing it with a hacker or someone else"
378,1," So how does the cloud provider you know, address those types of risks and really this this less of an ability to monitor your data unless you've somehow put something in place or the the service provider themselves discloses things like you know: they're the ability of their services To to really deliver on what they promised all important questions to ask when getting into the wind getting into a cloud situation, so let's them too? How does this apply to financial institutions? Well, in the United States, there's something called the FFIEC"
379,1," You can see federal financial institutions, examination council and what that is, it's a really consortium of financial regulators and they issue regulation and they call it guidance from time to time"
380,1," It'S not necessarily the same as a regulation, but it does carry the same weight if you're, not in compliance you're, going to end up on the wrong side of the regulator's, which is not something you want and they have"
381,1, They have pretty much come out and said: they've actually come out and said that you need to do due diligence on a cloud service provider
382,1, You need to confirm they can comply with any regulatory changes that may came up to come up and regulatory structures that are already in place
383,1, You need to be able to audit the IT side of it need to have effective monitoring of information security and to make sure they have the resources so that you can continue doing business right
384,1," You wouldn't want to see your bank shut down because their service provider went out of business or or there was a maybe an earthquake at a data center or something like that, and these are important from the customer side, the company buying cloud services"
385,1," But I think it's it's crucial for companies that want to provide services to financial institutions need to understand this because you can, you can come into the marketplace and say: we've got a great cloud offering and you're going to try to sell to financial institutions"
386,1," But if you ignore these regulations, you're never going to get traction you're not going to be able to sell to a big financial institution because because their stock, they have to abide by these things"
387,1," Now, when you Europe, you know it has its own set of privacy regulations and they actually have a issued a set of standards for cloud computing very similar to the US version, but it's actually more detailed they've got model terms and conditions for service level agreements"
388,1," Certainly, they have data protection, security standards, interrupt the built interoperability and data portability standards, and then they have for the environmental side"
389,1, They have standards for consumption and emission
390,1," You know, typically with with these large data centers, they can use a lot of energy and contribute a lot of heat and carbon to the environment, briefly just to touch on case law, the use of cloud computing 10"
391,1, This first case increase the number of contacts or personal jurisdiction
392,1, I don't know how many lawyers are out there
393,1," I don't want to get the non lawyers rolling their eyes, but really what this means is, if you're hiring a service provider who has a data center in Ireland and you're in the US, and someone slips and falls at the data center in Ireland, you can be Sued, you can you, can they can say hey this Court has jurisdiction over"
394,1, You
395,1, You'Ve got this
396,1," If not your data center you're you're using the data center, but it's been founded, it can contribute to a finding of jurisdiction"
397,1, There similar thing happened with this Cablevision case
398,1, The second case is that the the the company itself was not infringing
399,1," The question was, you know, are they they're downloading all this data and they're putting copyrighted material in the data center and then it gets copied several times? A similar question came up"
400,1, Is that copyright infringement this court found it wasn't because they were merely storing it for them? So that's that's good to know that you're not going to be held liable for that in that situation
401,1," From the final case here, this is really Google fighting against Microsoft"
402,1, Microsoft had been picked for some federal contract and Google was just fighting saying it wasn't a fair and open situation
403,1," I think, as part of the cloud wars between the big cloud companies, this kind of thing you'll see more and more of so, let's touch quickly on negotiating issues"
404,1, You really need to address the IT and business exec objectives to know what they are ahead of time and be able to manage those different objectives
405,1," There needs to be flexibility in the relationship, especially when you're you're, getting into a situation where you're putting important sensitive data on the cloud"
406,1," You need to know that it's protected, you need to be able to get to it in an emergency, and you need to be able to"
407,1, You want to be able to grow because you start to become reliant on cloud service providers and it's hard to switch
408,1," It'S hard to switch to another vendor, so you want to have some flexibility so that for the from the customer side you want to grow it and then from the service provider"
409,1, Certainly you want to be able to grow the relationship with the customer
410,1," You want to make it easy for the customer to buy more services from you, so I think an awareness of these issues would help service providers make give a better, offering and find more attraction in the market"
411,1, Just briefly touch on liability issues
412,1, There
413,1," Certainly, identification is a big issue"
414,1," To one extent, will the service provider be responsible for things like data breaches? As I said, the regulators aren't going to excuse the financial institution just because they have outsourced their computing services, some cloud provider, so the cloud customer again is going to have to look to that cloud provider to say you know"
415,1," To what extent are you going to be responsible? A lot depends on leverage that, at the same time, you know the market reality is that the there's a demand for this sort of thing and the vendors are going to have a difficult time really getting traction"
416,1," Certainly with with bigger players in the financial services industry, they might sign a contract here, contract there at a big company, but sooner or later the CIO is going to get wind of it and I've seen it happen where you know some cloud provider or some SAS Provider has picked off this division, that division and then all of a sudden, one of the c-level executives finds out about it and they threaten to terminate the contract or they force them to renegotiate"
417,1, And you know with a big enough customer
418,1, It'S going to have an effect consequential damages
419,1," These are typically excluded, although there's some confidentiality restrictions that are carved out of that, let's say and then the contract is usually limited to direct damages"
420,1, This can work from both sides and there's is actually a a insurance requirements
421,1, Insurance to surance companies typically require some kind of cap
422,1," I'M just I'm going to go quicker here, we're running low on time as there's other stuff"
423,1, I want to cover service levels
424,1," I think, if you're familiar with this industry, certainly you want to know what service you're getting and have something in place that describes that, for for some service levels that are important, you might be able to get service level credits, although that is, is harder and harder To find with cloud services termination rights, you want to be able to terminate, but, more importantly, the problem is: what do you do? It'S it's not always a termination sounds like it's the the right remedy, but for the customer it's not always easy"
425,1," How you get out of that relationship? You'Ve got data, you've, got clients using that service or accessing that service through your systems"
426,1," How do you really address it and really the big issue here? The last point: there data data data, that's really it you know, and that's it's part of them"
427,1, It'S a double-edged sword
428,1," It'S nice to have cloud services, they're very useful, but you've got your service"
429,1," Your data, your most important data, you know - can be in someone else's hands, and how do you address that? You have any further questions in this area? There'S something called the cloud security alliance"
430,1, This is a nonprofit organization that promotes the use of best practices in cloud computing
431,1," It has security, trust and assurance registry, which addresses security controls, and you can you can even get a certificate of competency in cloud security issues"

450,0," What'S more, security card numbers are easily leaked and one-time number generators are difficult to carry accordingly"
451,1, Companies are competing fiercely to develop a solution for such limited security technologies
452,1, Among the most promising methods for ID verification is the use of biometrics
453,1," Biometric identification uses unique bodily information for security, offering advantages in terms of both safety and convenience"
454,1, Fingerprint and iris scans are already used in smartphone and financial security
455,1," A domestic company specializing in biometrics recently received attention with its development of a verification method, more intricate than iris or fingerprint scans"
456,1," It uses vein patterns in the user's hand, to verify identity, the method projects near-infrared light on the veins in a user's finger and verifies the image"

480,1,"[ Music ] hi, I'm Ali Paterson, on this episode of finding finance, we're taking a look at compliance and innovation"
481,1," For this we speak with push for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, SCB and Rabobank"
482,1," Firstly, I went to speak with mike williams from push for to hear a little bit about the impact that gdpr is going to have on the industry"
483,1, We'Re gon na see a lot of fines because I think we you know the reality is
484,1," Banks are not gon na, be they're gon na be ready by May 2018"
485,1, It'S gon na be a quite a long journey
486,0," There'S a lot of issues are going to need to resolve in terms of you know, legacy systems and you know changing the way they operate and then probably adding to those systems and extending you know the capability of what they currently have"
487,1, So it's a journey
488,1, So I think you know there will be a large number of finds in in terms of brexit
489,1, I don't think it really changes anything
490,1, It was interesting
491,1, Recently there was a report where I think it said one in four organizations has cancelled their preparation
492,1," You know when they heard a brexit thinking, you know gtp, I wouldn't applies them anymore, but basically, if you hold any date on EU residents, it doesn't matter where your operation is"
493,1," You know in the world, you know whether you're a US company, a PAC company European company, gdpr replies to you"
494,1," So you know, I think again, eights there's, probably an education process that needs to take place, still some organizations on what what GTR really means and that and the true impact it could have on their"
495,1, But I think it's gon na be a hectic few years
496,1," I said Douglas Mackenzie to speak with Matthew Davies, to hear a little bit around these new regulations and the positive impact they may have"
497,0, A lot of the time regulation drives a lot of challenges
498,0, You know banks have to spend a lot of money each year investing to stay current with changing regulations
499,0, Corporates have to comply with changing regulations and some of those pressures filter through one sights or the other
500,1," But I think there is, as you say, there's a very, very positive opportunity that comes from regulatory change as well"
501,1," Great example would be PSD to payment services directive 2 and when you look at what that regulation is doing, it's really opening up the market for more providers to provide banking type services, whilst the account providers are are opening up to allow those providers to compete"
502,1," In this space, I think that that is both a threat and an opportunity for the existing players in the market and the positive change from a technology perspective"
503,1," That'S being driven out of that is obviously ap ice, and you know when you think about the potential application of api's"
504,1, We think there's some really really interesting possibilities and will really shift the dynamic between how companies and banks interact with one another and when you start to combine that with the move towards real-time payment
505,1," I think you're gon na see some very, very interesting solutions developed from banks and other providers in this space Douglas then traveled to Sweden to speak with Rasmus y'all bought from SCB to hear a little bit around the opportunities that gdpr represents"
506,1, Sure
507,1," I think if you look at GDP R, it is a game changer not just for banks, but for all industries, and for once this is not a piece of regulation that only hits the financial industry, but it's across the board and there I would say, if anything, Us banks have an advantage: we've lived under similar regulation for years"
508,1, This is a new piece of regulation
509,1," I think we are very good at handling customer data, but it becomes a different paradigm because it's two main things right: the right to be forgotten, and if you consider that we have multiple systems with where your address, for example, is stored, it become about knowing all The places that information is stored in being able to wipe it and, secondly, to be able to move your data to another provider which really again isn't something we've had to do so it needs to be"
510,1," We need to standardize the data and the metadata around the data and be able to transfer that, but, as with any regulation, if you look at GDP our, if we look at some of the other stuff that's coming in, we really try to align it to our Own values as a bank, and because we think, transparency and fairness to customers and and access and control of your own data is something that the customers should have for us"
511,1, It becomes less of a philosophical issue and more of just a technical sort of conundrum
512,1," How do we comply in the best possible way? How do you make is easy to use for the customers? If anything we see, GDP are a sort of a snow plow for some when the data work that needs to be done anyway, to become more data driven to onboard more data sources onto the lake"
513,1," We say if we're going to be compliant, which we have to be, and here are some of the steps we need to take"
514,1, You know what those steps will also help us become better at using data from lots of other purposes
515,1," So we see it really when we keep looking for it, not the regulatory arbitrage, but for the synergies of what the legislation is trying to do"
516,1, We want to do yeah it's interesting
517,1," So if I go back to the whole issue, around unstructured content and and let's - let's take - you - know a representation to the problem in terms of potential hacks and data leakage, then the problem is really goes back to sending content now"
518,1," In some cases, email is fit for purpose, but in other cases it isn't because part of GPR requires you to put in systems that are secured by design email"
519,1," Isn'T you know if you take any any email scenario, you end up with multiple footprints of content throughout your organization or external to the organization, completely out of control, so the exciting thing, and if you look at what we do it push for, is the key"
520,1," The key takeaway from push for is push, don't send, so we have a a US patent for what we call pushing content and in a push all the content stays secured by design on the server"
521,1, It never leaves the server
522,1," So then, you think, how do you actually allow anybody to view it, and this is the clever thing behind the patterns"
523,1, It effectively projects a view of the content through to any device
524,1," You don't need any of the authoring software on the device and nothing is left on the device after the view, so nothing can be hacked into on the device"
525,1, So that fixes a lot of the issues around gdpr because you're preventing a potential hack into the content
526,1," You also prevent the issue around human behavior, which is, I might just forward it accidentally or maliciously to someone I shouldn't, because you can control the number of views how long I'm allowed to do it, for if I try and screenshot the content, it kills"
527,1," The content and notifies the author, and if, if at any point I need to pull back the content, I can and then on the other side is I have this live link through to the content and, and it means I can absolutely monitor what the end user Is doing in terms of their consumption and content, so I know where they viewed the content, so I could GGO ring-fence the content to an office or a country"
528,1, I can absolutely detect
529,1, You know what they're doing in terms of viewing right down to a section level
530,1," So you can imagine you know if I might be looking at particular set of products, information and then that you know that would be fed back immediately"
531,1," So I may, you know, then engage with them to help them through understanding the product better"
532,1," So you get this full control, you get full analytics back from the content consumption, so you address gdpr and, at the same time allow people to access real-time content on their own device"
533,1," So you know bring your own device, which is again a big driver for the bank, so that way, allowing people to bring their own device means I, as a consumer, can access content wherever it suits me best on whatever device it sees me best"
534,1, So I improve the customer engagement make it easier for me to do business with
535,1, I was interested to hear about some of the uses of big data and any compliance issues around this sure it's early days
536,1," Yet I think what is really happening today, a really good customer relationship manager could look at across the data almost manually right and put together a piece of advice for customers"
537,1, Saying I see that you have a young payment being made in you subsidiary in Brazil
538,1," You should swap that out before you have a cache call and your Tokyo, Treasury or whatever right, but today the customer would be impressed and happy with that advice tomorrow, it's gon na, be"
539,1," Why didn't you tell me you see everything? Why didn't you, hedge out my currency, exposure before you knew the cash sweep was coming? So I think that is really what you need to do with the data and we're starting with baby steps, but, for example, one of the things we're doing with our SME clients"
540,1, It'S kind of the Amazon next product to buy we're all used to this
541,1," For my personal lives, you buy a book next time, you're into Amazon"
542,1, It will tell you you: should you probably like this book we're using that same technology and that same algorithm to really see a for an SME company? Here'S what you have other companies your size with your geographical exposure usually have this
543,1," I can say it's pretty simple, but for the customers actually a value, add today using big data on the private side"
544,1," It'S I talked about our investment in tank now tank, of course, and their site aggregates all your financial information and so being able to say you know, you're actually earning a subpar interest rate here wanting to move swap this setting to here or your mortgage payment there's"
545,1, So many bits above what other people in your area are paying
546,1, So that's something we're experimenting with we're
547,1," Also, looking at mortgage churn, which interesting once when, when my customer swaps out our mortgage for some other banks mortgage, and we used to not really understand why customers were leaving us"
548,1, And we looked at that in the data model with only three months - historical data
549,1, And now experimenting and testing different drivers
550,1, We'Ve actually been able to predict with 74 % accuracy when a customer will leave us two weeks before their
551,1, They know they're gon na leave us right
552,1," So it really changes the paradigm on the marketing and being able to did a very specific, very tailored marketing"
553,1," Where you know the customer representative so far will call up and say you know: how are you happy with your mortgage? You know we may see that you want to move, and you know we would love to provide you with a mortgage in your new house and the rest of it right, but really using that data proactively is what it's all about"
554,1," I would just urge them to understand the difference between push, don't send because it's a quick fix, it's something that they can implement immediately and it would prevent the data the risk of a data leak which effectively is 80 percent of the risk for them"
555,1, Based around the unstructured content is something can do immediately and it's complimentary to the systems that are already have in place
556,1," So you know, while you're working out, you know what to do long-term, stop the biggest threat you know plug the leak over in the Netherlands"
557,1, I caught up with Finbar Hayes from Rabobank to hear about some of the customer experience issues when it comes to managing big data day
558,1, Data is the basis of customer interaction
559,1," I think we make a big thing out of data, but basically, when you do a face-to-face interview, you're also reading data and acting upon the data, I think in the ideal world, your automation will do the same thing that we are doing right now"
560,1," You will get a question you will answer, and the next question will be ideally based on the answer you gave just before that you're, seeing more and more of that and getting better and better"
561,1," I think there are a lot of instances, especially in the in the service field, where this automated question answer is being used all the time, and I think the customer doesn't really notice and I think the opposite"
562,1, When you ask what time will my flight leave? You can have either the agents looking it up and taking the time or you can have the computer saying hey at least at this at this by the way it's 15 minutes delayed
563,1," You get instance, instance reply to your question"
564,1, In effect this Altima bit ultimately better
565,1," If you take advanced step further and a client says great, it's 15 minutes delayed"
566,1," Where can I get a sandwich, then you sort of starts reaching the limitations of today's customer experience and possibilities of data, but that will exponentially grow"
567,1," I guess in the end, making human intervention only there, where it adds immediate value where it goes into the area's more classic or areas of of banking services like complicated advice and complicated situations"
568,1, So I think it's a it's
569,1, It'S a it's an integral part and it can only get get better
570,1, So where do you draw the line between using that information? Yeah? It'S it's
571,1," Like the example I gave, I think, for a simple question answer: there's no substituting ocean automation"
572,1," Computer can do it much faster, much more accurate, much more real-time than any human could ever it's when it gets"
573,1, It gets complicated and there are a lot of variations that there's still a huge challenge
574,1," We are able, when we we take artificial intelligence and chatbots in a really careful in a careful approach"
575,1," Ray Bank has always been one of the most human banks in our market area, and we intend to to still be that or at least make that one of our core competences or perceived competence, and we we think it also goes for it ball situation"
576,1," So we are looking for really the human touch in in said bolts as well, so we we take"
577,1, We take the following approach
578,1," We have started an internal pilot with chatbots, so we use our internal helpdesk system over the 40 50 thousand people that we employ"
579,1, They talk to chat box and they are now perfecting the way Ted BOTS work in a rebel ink environment
580,1, I was interested to hear about the areas in which these analytics are being applied and the effect this will have when it comes to future data usage
581,1," I think, as a bank of course, we've been privileged to have a lot of information about our customers"
582,1, What we need to do is become much better at using it much better at compiling what we call a 360 degree view of the customer and and to do that as an organization
583,1, We need to become more data-driven
584,1, That means relying on that
585,0," What the data is telling you, and not what your gut feeling is telling you, and to do that"
586,0," I think we needed first and foremost to really set our sights on what we can achieve with data and we've we've done that through our vision, but also them to start working on a technical platform"
587,0," There'S a lot of talk about data lakes, but most banks are running electronic data warehouses from the 90s"
588,1," How do you transfer into this modern technology, and then that is a journey that we're firmly on and that's gone very well and I'm happy to say that already now our data Lake is up and running we're running a Hortonworks install of the Hadoop cluster"
589,1," We have our master data management hub from informatica, spinning, which knows the golden record golden source for each piece of information, but the job now becomes to start cleaning"
590,1," Some of the data in the customer divisions and onboarding it into the lake, which you may say is a data puddle at this point, but the architecture is there: it's now about filling it with data"
591,1, That'S on the data engineering side
592,1," Now, on the advanced analytics side, it becomes more of a almost cultural change and having the essential, advanced analytics team, which we call SP analytics to work closely with the customer insight and CRM teams and in the customer facing divisions to say, look, here's what's possible"
593,1," You know, ask us any question and we will try to help you with that answer and so that it becomes really opening the businesses eyes or saying you know you don't have to guess anymore"
594,1," You don't have to infer, you can ask us and we can go through the reams and reams of data instruct putting together multi-factor models and algorithms beyond sort of the can of what what a human can"
595,1, Hypothesize
596,1, You don't need to apologize
597,1," The the systems will find a pattern in the data for you, and once you realize that you realized the sky is the limit, what you can do with this data right and so really firmly on that on that journey, we appointed a chief data scientist only last Week, who's now working closely with the divisions on really getting some of the use cases running, I think, for for a financial institution or or bank one obvious area would be, would be assessing credit risk and that's something you you basically want to get right"
598,1," You you think you want to have the company as your clients, based on the assumptions you make or the assessment you make on the risk"
599,1, This company will will bring and you're just for pricing
600,1," Accordingly, your acceptance policies, that's something we"
601,1," We have a lot of rules for in place historically, but that's something out of data that you can make ultimately more advanced"
602,1," Looking at patterns looking at predictions, looking at past behavior looking at peer behavior, basically getting a picture of the clients before you know the client"
603,1," That'S an area where you see a lot of lot of data initiatives going with us, but also with our competitors, basically risk assessment as a service, providing it to ourselves, of course, to get a better portfolio, but you in open banking"
604,1, You could also do that for basically anybody who would be interested in an assessment of a company and when a supplier gets a new client
605,1, You want to make sure that there will be
606,1, There will be a paying client
607,1," We could use the data and the experience that we have to basically assist in making that assessment, but also for us"
608,1," It gives us a better view on the client today and what we expect in in in the next couple of years, in order to to to adjust our pricing mechanisms in terms of ways the financial service industry"
609,1, What are some of the changes that you see happening soon? Yeah? I think a lot of the changes will actually be driven by a cultural and behavioral change
610,1," You know by the end consumer and, like you know, I think, we've seen evidence of that recently"
611,1, You know the pace at which we've seen as a move towards instant messaging and on personal lives and social media and our personal lives
612,0," I think it's fair to say the banks have fallen behind in terms of working out how to address that in you know, within their own organization and and guess what you know, the people are coming to work who are used to a new way of communicating in Their personal lives they like that way of communicating and they expect the same ease of access to content and communication within the workplace"
613,0," So I think, there's going to have to be a rapid understanding of what that that behavioral shift means in the workplace and also you know, how did how do you put in systems to actually keep up to pace because it's moving at such such a pace? You know again, the danger will be for a lot of the traditional banks  Is you know they just will not be able to maintain a pace"
614,1," That'S going to be, you know anywhere near what the consumer is going to expect now"
615,0," I know a lot of the banks or you know, have business models now where they're working with you know third party and new brands that are emerging, and I think they are better positioned because they have less of a legacy to you know hold them back"
616,1," So you know, maybe you know one of the ships we'll see is actually the brands of the future that we're interacting with or not the brands that we're actually interacting with today on the next episode of FinTech finance, we're going back to look at the world of Rechtin "
617,1,"Blockchain, AI FinTech changes in the economy, trust digital identity"
618,1," What are these things and what do they mean for us? Because that's what matters Today on CXOTalk we're speaking with David Shrier, who is a futurist"
619,1,? He is a man with many talents and many interests
620,1, He's going to read the future for us
621,1,: Hey David Shrier
622,1, How are you Thanks so much for joining CXOTalk today
623,1, Absolutely
624,1,? Thank you Michael for having me
625,1, I'M really excited to speak with you and your audience about what the future holds
626,1, David tell us briefly about the scope of your interests
627,1," It'S pretty extraordinary, actually"
628,1,"! Well, I've been really lucky because I'm a little bit of a geek groupie"
629,1,", I like hanging out with really smart people and learning from them where things are going"
630,1, I have a dual appointment at the MIT Media Lab at the University of Oxford Said: Business School
631,1," I get to hang out on both sides of the pond, with some people who are not just envisioning the future, but actually creating it"
632,1, One thing we like to say at the media lab is the best way to predict the future is to create it
633,1, Then I also run a software company that I spun out of MIT called Distilled Analytics
634,1, Okay
635,1,", Really quickly tell us what is Distilled Analytics, Give us the 15-second, pitch"
636,1," Yeah, so we're an AI biometric software company"
637,1," We create digital identity profiles for financial institutions to help them work better with their customers around things like making loans, securing their data systems or managing risk"
638,1, It'S a big problem
639,1, There are 3
640,0,5 billion people in the world who are not well served by our current financial system 
641,1,and we're trying to help
642,1, You also wrote a book
643,1,", Well you've written a number of books"
644,1, This one is called Trust
645,1, :Data
646,1, We're going to be talking about this topic as well during our excursion in the next 45 minutes or so
647,1," David you're, an entrepreneur"
648,1, You're focused on innovation
649,1," You're, focused on business models"
650,1,", I've just thrown out a whole bunch of buzzwords"
651,1, So let's begin with startups
652,1," What are the implications of all of these changes for somebody who is starting a company or they're running a company they're looking to raise money, Tell us about that"
653,1,", It's a really exciting time to be an entrepreneur"
654,1," The implications of all these different technologies of AI, of Blockchain, digital identity and all of the transformational technologies that are now engaging with multiple levels of society are that there are going to be inefficiencies that emerge"
655,1, There are going to be challenges that big companies can't move fast enough to grapple with
656,1," That'S where an opportunity arises for entrepreneurs, someone who is nimble, someone who can see a little further ahead and someone who is now bound by all the red tape that wraps around big companies"
657,1," I think the next five to ten years are going to be a tremendous opportunity for someone who, as entrepreneurial spirit"
658,1,", What should entrepreneurs do to take advantage of these disruptive changes? Well, the first thing and it may sound facile, but many people forget - is just to solve a problem"
659,1, Figure out
660,1, What problem are you solving specifically and where do you have some unique advantage to pursue it
661,1, You might have novel expertise or insight
662,1, You might have invented some new technology
663,1, Somehow you need a way of solving a problem that is impacting a lot of companies or a lot of people
664,1," Once you identify your problem, then you can help build out a business around your solution"
665,1," Is there something that is unique today about these disruptions, The notion of solving a problem, that's sort of timeless advice"
666,0,"? What about today? Well, there are brand new technologies emerging that large organizations are still struggling to get their arms"
667,1, Around
668,1, Blockchain is a great example
669,1, That is a new kind of database essentially
670,1, It'S a distributed database technology
671,1,", It's something that is very interesting not only for the financial services industry, but for a number of other industries, whether it's consulting transportation or healthcare"
672,0, The large organizations still haven't figured out what they're going to do about blockchain
673,1, That realm of the proliferation of new technology and the opportunity for nimble experimentation is where entrepreneurs really shine
674,1, You can try out a lot of different ideas quickly without having to go to a committee and go through nine rounds of budget approval
675,1, Within these sort of broad categories of a big tech lots of disruption
676,1, I think there are going to be some novel solutions emerging where the ability to rapidly iterate different experiments around solutions
677,1,", For example, with blockchain"
678,1, We still don't really know what it's best killer
679,1, App is
680,1, People are still figuring that out
681,1, I like to say about blockchain
682,1, It is both less and more than people say it is
683,1, In the near-term
684,1, It'S a lot less than the hype
685,1, In the longer-term
686,1, I think the impacts are going to be more profound
687,1, Yes
688,1, We'll be talking more about blockchain as we go forward for sure
689,1, Just to close up advice for entrepreneurs
690,1, You'Ve been doing this for a long time
691,1, You talk with a lot of people
692,1," What is the essence of what advice you would offer Build something fast, get it in front of people and get their feedback"
693,1, I am a huge fan of the market discovery process where you go out and you actually talk to customers
694,1, You see if that idea you have about the problem that you're trying to solve is actually viable
695,1," Don'T just sit in a room or make business cards and say ``, Look, I'm an entrepreneur"
696,1,"'', Actually build something go out and show it to people and try and get them to use"
697,1, It
698,1," Of course, the great innovator and teacher Steve Blank says: `` Get out"
699,1,''
700,1, What is his phrase exactly `` Get out of the office
701,1,"'', My favorite one is that he says that startups are search engines for business models"
702,1,", But absolutely you want to get out of the office and find out from talking to customers"
703,1, What is the problem that you're solving and is the solution? You came up really viable
704,1, All right
705,1, We've just been talking about startups
706,1," Now, let's turn to large companies"
707,1, How should large companies large organizations thinking about these disruptive issues you were just describing? The dynamics are completely different for a large established business than for a startup
708,1," If I wanted to be clickbait-y, I'd, say: `` Be afraid"
709,1,", Be very afraid"
710,1,"'', But less facetiously"
711,1, I think big organizations need to take these new technologies very seriously
712,1," I think there's a tremendous opportunity for corporate innovation, which does require risk-taking"
713,1, Big companies need to increase their failure
714,1, Tolerance for small-scale experiments
715,1,", Try out a lot of different experiments"
716,1," Eighty-percent of those experiments should fail or you're, not being experimental enough"
717,1, You want to try and figure out how you can reposition your organization for this new future
718,1, The impacts are going to be profound
719,1,", For example, • In financial services"
720,0," We think there could be anywhere from 30 % to 50 % of jobs lost in the next 7 years, so to 2 million to 6 million jobs"
721,1, Just in the U
722,1,S
723,1, North America and Western Europe from disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain
724,1, • In the transportation industry autonomous vehicles are going to replace long-haul trucking
725,1, Five-percent of employment in the U
726,1,S
727,1, is going to be upended as a result of automation
728,1," • In the healthcare industry, opportunities for improving quality of care and dramatically reducing costs can emerge from using combinations of technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain"
729,1, That'S $ 3 trillion-plus in the U
730,1,S
731,1, and $ 5 trillion to $ 6 trillion globally
732,1,", That's a lot of dough! That is going to be undergoing movement, dislocation and repositioning"
733,1,", And so big companies have opportunities to carve out new markets as well as new market share"
734,1, If they're smart about the adoption of new technologies
735,1, Okay
736,0," David, we all know that yeah if companies are smart, but we all know that companies on a visceral level, big companies, kind of hate to innovate because it disrupts their existing revenue streams"
737,0," They say they want to innovate, but it's not so easy"
738,1, It is difficult
739,1," Clay Christensen wrote about this very famously in The Innovator's Dilemma, where you get really good at doing one thing, so it's hard to try something new"
740,0," What I see a lot is something I call the corporate immune response where, when a new idea comes up, the white blood cells of the company come and attack it and kill the new idea"
741,1, Yeah
742,1, The antibodies corporate antibodies
743,1, You've got to create systems that help protect
744,1, That new idea from the corporate antibodies
745,1, - It's not all doom and gloom
746,1,", Some large organizations have figured out ways to embrace new technologies"
747,1," For example, I was on a panel last January at World Economic Forum in Davos, with the CEO of Accenture North America"
748,1," They very fervently and widely embraced artificial intelligence and adopted it into their organization, but they did something really enlightened that a lot of companies don't do"
749,1, They took 60 % of the cost savings that they got from the labor change around artificial intelligence and they invested it in reskilling
750,1, They said `` Okay
751,1, We've got all these people
752,1, It was expensive to find them expensive to recruit them expensive to train them
753,1," Now that we've got them here, rather than just throw them out of work when we adopt AI we're going to repurpose them for higher-order tasks"
754,1,"'', It is absolutely not impossible for big companies to innovate, and it is not impossible for big companies to embrace new technology"
755,0," It is difficult and it requires courage, leadership and a willingness to allow small failures along the way to finding the big success"
756,1," We've had on this show a couple of times actually Paul Dougherty, who is Accenture's chief technology and innovation officer"
757,1, They are a good example of innovation
758,1, What advice have you got for companies to not fall prey to that innovation? Antibody syndrome? A few things
759,1," I've worked with and for 11 different Fortune 1000 companies, helping them with various new division, new product launches and innovation"
760,1, Efforts
761,1, You need executive sponsorship from the very top of the organization
762,1, The CEO needs to say: `` Innovation is important and I'm going to stand behind it
763,1,''
764,1," If you don't have that senior-level executive sponsorship, there will be other dynamics that emerge that make innovation difficult or impossible"
765,1, You need to have a dedicated function around identifying new opportunities and incubating them
766,1," That protected environment, that kind of greenhouse, that's separate from the main organization"
767,1, So it's not a distraction
768,1,", Then you need a translation mechanism that allows that new idea once you've matured it enough to make its way into the mainstream organization"
769,1," A number of the large banks, for example, have begun adopting this model"
770,1, So BBVA is a great example of a large bank that has created a successful innovation function
771,1, That'S also able to bridge those new ideas into the broader organization
772,1," David I've seen chief innovation officers in some cases fall prey to the organization paying lip service to the desire to innovate, but not funding it properly or even more likely"
773,1, Creating incentives for the organization to not innovate
774,1,", You have this kind of schizophrenia in some instances"
775,1, Yeah
776,1," We call that innovation theater, when the organization kind of dances to the tune of innovation on a show and tell basis, but doesn't actually do anything in a substantive fashion"
777,1," Again, we come back to this idea"
778,1," If you have C-suite sponsorship, you align budget and incentives, and you have a disciplined process that says: ``"
779,0," Okay, now that we've done 100 experiments and we've found the 5 things that we want to move forward, we're going to put serious resources behind them and fund the 3- to 5-year development chain that it will take to get from that sort of early-stage idea to a Successful scaled business. Companies, don't have the patience for that 3- to 5-year cycle"
780,1,'' Now another issue is sometimes big
781,1," In that case, they'll innovate through acquisition"
782,1," There there's a whole other set of rules around making sure that if you are going to innovate through acquisition, if you're going to say `` Look, we have a low cost of capital"
783,1," So our best way to innovate is to acquire ,'' that you don't kill the thing that you just bought"
784,1,", [ Laughter, ], That you have an intelligent way of bringing its best qualities into your organization without destroying what it is that you acquired in the first place"
785,1, Okay
786,1, Final final advice for large companies
787,1,": I know you've been giving a lot of advice, but what's the hardest single problem they face when they try to innovate and take advantage of these disruptive technologies Embracing an innovation mindset"
788,0,", I actually find that a lot of big companies Are filled with great ideas, but people get tentative , They have trouble, bringing it forward"
789,0, Leadership is focused on something else and has trouble focusing or listening to these ideas 
790,0, Helping reframe your thinking around being willing to try the new and being willing to embrace the new idea is probably the hardest thing that these organizations have in terms Of making the shift in something that they really need to invest the most in developing
791,1, Okay
792,1," I wanted to remind everybody, we're speaking with David Shrier"
793,1, He is a futurist
794,1, He's an entrepreneur
795,1," He is the author of this book, Trust :Data"
796,1,", That's it"
797,1,", As well as a bunch of other books"
798,1, Let'S talk about analytics and data
799,1,", We hear these catchphrases `` Data is the new oil"
800,1,''
801,1," I'M not sure what exactly that means, but it sounds good"
802,1," We know data is really important, so why? What'S going on with data with analytics David Because of more and more ubiquitous devices? So I'm speaking to you now through an iPhone X which has a very pretty camera, so it makes for good visuals"
803,1, We have and many people have an Amazon Echo or a Siri
804,1, They have some kind of device in their home
805,1,", As these connected devices get more and more ubiquitous as they have better and better sensors and, as the networks get better we're, generating more and more and more data about ourselves about our lives, about commerce and about society"
806,1," What'S interesting, is that not only are we generating all that data, but the computing power and the sophistication of analytics are now reaching the point where we can understand this data"
807,1," We can actually do something with it and make it useful, For example, with artificial intelligence, People have been talking about the big wave of change that AI is going to drive for 40 or 50 years, but we've only started to see it come to fruition in the last 10 because the computers, the networks, the algorithms, have finally gotten sophisticated enough to be Useful"
808,1," - And so it's now a very very exciting time, if you're engaged in the world of data or analytics because of the potential power to help make a better society"
809,1," Dude, that's pretty abstract `` Make a better society"
810,1,'' Elaborate on that one please
811,1," Well, there are a bunch of problems we can solve now that we had trouble solving before"
812,1, There are a billion people in the world who lack a legal identity
813,1, They don't exist in the eyes of government
814,1," They're, mostly women and children, and they're abused, they're trafficked and they're exploited"
815,1," With the advent of newer technologies, the UN has set a Sustainable Development Goal, SDG 16"
816,1,9 that says by 2030
817,1, Everyone on the planet will have an identity
818,1," These new digital technologies can help create that identity in a way that's much less expensive, much more robust and much more useful"
819,1, My company is working now with another company in the UN around providing these digital identities to refugees
820,1, There are 3
821,0,5 billion people who are underserved or unserved by today's financial system
822,0, That'S holding back economic growth and economic progress
823,0, Ninety-Five percent of the world's small businesses are underserved by banks
824,1," That'S holding back economic progress, because small businesses create four out of five new jobs"
825,1, All of these things can be better served and actually addressed through the new kinds of data and analytics that we can use leveraging technologies like artificial intelligence
826,1," How can companies of all sizes take advantage of these data and analytic capabilities? What kind of toolsets are needed? What kind of data? How should they be thinking about aggregating the data collecting the data that they require? Well, a couple of things"
827,1, You used an important word there
828,1, You said: `` Aggregating data
829,1,"'', I'm going to come back to that in a second"
830,1, The first thing the organizations can do is improve their data
831,1, Literacy
832,1, People throw around words like data and analytics without really understanding what they mean
833,1," People, throw around words like causality, which is essentially did thing over here, A lead to event over here B"
834,1, A lot of people make assumptions about cause and effect that turn out to be false
835,1, So there's a wonderful book that I'm reading called The Book of
836,1, Why which talks about this idea of causality so getting a better understanding of data and of just some basics of statistics
837,1,? I'M not saying you're going to become a data scientist or data programmer
838,1," I'M saying that, with a few weeks of training, with a little bit of effort, the general manager can understand enough about data analytics to ask intelligent questions of their data scientists"
839,1, The data scientists should be able to answer those questions
840,1," That level of data literacy, I think, is critical"
841,1, Once you're asking the right questions that can help mobilize your organization towards developing the right answers
842,1, From a management perspective
843,1," It is essential to understand enough about data and analytics, so you can ask the experts, ask your data scientists, the right questions"
844,1, And come up with the right strategies as well
845,1," It'S not only asking the right questions of your people, but also coming up with strategies for how to marshal their resources"
846,1, You just mentioned earlier this concept of data
847,1, Aggregation
848,1, Can companies be thinking about different ways to aggregate data In the book? Trust :Data that we talk about
849,1, We actually espouse something different
850,1," We espouse what's known as a federated model, which means you don't aggregate the data"
851,1," You don't do what Equifax did, which is put a lot of data into one giant pile and make it easy for hackers to get to"
852,1, You leave the data in the more secure distributed manner and you send the algorithms to the data
853,1, You create different kinds of software and you put them together with the data
854,1, Then the software generates answers off of this federated data
855,1, Understanding that new data architecture is also important
856,1, GDPR
857,1, The General Data Protection Regulation has been passed in Europe
858,1," It has implications not only for European companies, but for any company that does business with a European citizen"
859,1,", Even if they fly from Europe over to the U"
860,1,S
861,1, and are walking around the U
862,1,S
863,1," If you're touching their personal data, you are subject in some fashion to GDPR"
864,1, This has caused a lot of consternation in corporate C-suites around what the heck do
865,1," We do with GDPR, and what does it mean for us, Longer-term these innovations and policies around things like GDPR and around PSD2, and some analogous and somewhat weaker efforts going on in the U"
866,1,S
867,1, These things will all actually create new business opportunities for companies as much as they are currently generating better protections for consumers
868,1," Understanding that changing landscape is something that is not optional for a big company, whether you're a healthcare company dealing with health records, you're, a social media company dealing with social media profiles or you're a bank dealing with bank data"
869,1, Anyone who touches a consumer at any point needs to understand the new world of data and the new world of data privacy
870,1, Okay
871,1, We have a question from Twitter
872,1, I'll
873,1," Just ask you to respond to this very briefly, because we have so much that we have yet to cover during this relatively short"
874,1, Conversation
875,1," Arsalan Khan makes the important point that for many executives for many managers, data means either blind acceptance or an excuse to veto something without fully understanding the implications"
876,0," How do we overcome that issue inside companies? Well, I think leadership needs to become more aware of the risks of that binary approach of just sort of throw everything out or just sort of say yes to everything, That creates real risk that can impact market cap to the tune of tens of billions of dollars"
877,1, I point you to Exhibit A Facebook's market cap
878,1, Facebook is not an evil company
879,1, It'S not a company that set out to destroy people's lives
880,1, That was not their mission
881,1,", But through a failure to properly understand the nuances of the personal data that they were aggregating and using, they created tremendous shareholder value destruction"
882,1, They are now undergoing an effort to address that
883,1,", It's much better to close the barn door, while the horse is still in the barn"
884,1, Okay
885,1,", Fair enough"
886,1," Let'S talk about artificial intelligence and economics, the financial system"
887,1, How is AI going to change our relationship to money? Gosh
888,1, AI is going to change our relationship to money in many ways: large and small
889,1," At a macro level, let's say you're a decision-maker inside of a corporation or inside of a bank"
890,1, You want to understand --
891,1," Oh, I don't know"
892,1, -- inflation
893,1, Inflation has an impact on your cost of capital on your price of goods
894,1, It'S all sorts of things that are relevant to how you manage your business
895,1," Well, in the old days, you'd go to a government statistics, office and you'd have to wait six months"
896,1," Three months, six months a year after the passage of time for them to provide you a backward-looking assessment of what was the inflation that quarter"
897,1," Well thanks to AI and thanks to smart machine systems and some clever algorithms, one of my collaborators, Professor Roberto Rigobon, at MIT Sloan created a daily rate of inflation"
898,1,"  You're, not waiting 12 months to find out what inflation was -you can see it in real time and it's more accurate because it's based on real observations instead of on what turned out to be sometimes manipulated"
899,1, Statistics from various government statistics offices
900,1,: He now creates a daily rate of inflation for over 100 countries
901,1, That'S a powerful application of artificial intelligence that has profound real and wide-ranging effects for corporations and value for management
902,1, In small ways
903,1, Our lives are made easier every day when we talk into our phone and say ``
904,1," Where is that new restaurant that I want to go see? Where is the nearest Thai restaurant, ?'' or ,''? What'S the address of that office, I'm going to ?'', It seems silly, but it's improved our lives in little ways and made us a little more efficient"
905,1," What we can see coming in the next five to ten years is that those artificial, intelligent agents that live on our little smart devices are going to get a lot Smarter"
906,1," They're, going to customize to our particular interest and needs"
907,1," It'll, be like having a buddy"
908,1, Who is shadowing us who anticipates what we need and puts it in front of us before we even explicitly ask for it
909,1,"? That'S a really exciting way that, on a small scale, artificial intelligence is going to have an impact"
910,1," I was watching one of my favorite movies Cloud Atlas, the other night"
911,1,", That little drop of innovation goes into a multitude of drops in the ocean"
912,1,", And so, if we have people inside a company with these little AI buddies, who are helping them, be slightly more efficient Corporate productivity is going to skyrocket"
913,1, What about the impact on jobs and the potential for worker displacement
914,0, There is profound potential for worker displacement thanks to AI
915,1, If we're not careful
916,1, I say that because some worker displacement is not a bad thing
917,1, We are reallocating resources
918,1, In theory to something more efficient
919,1,", If we do what our friends at Accenture did and retrain those people and invest in reskilling, then we've done a great thing"
920,1," We'Ve helped improve efficiency, we're redeployed people against higher order tasks"
921,1, If we do what the steel industry in the British Midlands did in the'80s or the U
922,1, auto industry did in'80s and'90s and use automation to just throw people out of work and not retrain them
923,1, We create a generation of people who are permanently unemployed and unemployable
924,1, That'S going to create political problems
925,1,", It has already created political stress in the U"
926,1, and it's going to get worse
927,1, If we're not careful
928,1," Advice for managers, leaders inside large organizations who are reading about this stuff hearing, you talk and trying to say ``"
929,1," How do I get ahead of this ?'', A few things that you can do if you're inside a big organization or if you're a startup, if you're a leader who is trying to grapple with these changes? • First and foremost get smarter about it"
930,1, It'S important that you build your data and analytics literacy
931,1," • Second of all, invest in educating your people and keying them in on what they should be focused, on"
932,1,", Keying them in on creating new businesses"
933,1, Supporting them when they come forward with new ideas
934,1, • Finally embrace the startups
935,1, The big companies have an opportunity to take advantage of all of this innovation from all over the world
936,1, Using an open innovation model
937,1,", The very very smartest ones, are actually building innovation ecosystems"
938,1," This is a very sophisticated approach where you're saying `` We're not just doing open innovation, and we don't just have a shingle out where we let people have an ideas, box or something and submit ideas, but actually have a coordinated effort to engage with a number of Different stakeholders within their industry segment, who are pushing forward to the future and bringing that knowledge back for the larger organization to then implement it and drive change at scale"
939,1," A lot of what you've been talking about has been management, making intelligent decisions about how they lead with an open mind, essentially an open mindset"
940,1, Let'S talk about blockchain
941,1,", We all hear about blockchain"
942,1," [, Laughter ]"
943,1, Actually I was going to say we know
944,1," Bitcoin is not blockchain, but a lot of people think Bitcoin is blockchain"
945,1, What the hell is
946,1, Blockchain Okay
947,1, Blockchain is very simply a better kind of database
948,1, It's distributed
949,1,", Instead of as I used in my example earlier having all the data in one place in this big central repository that is attackable by hackers, you have it in lots of different places"
950,1, A thousand copies of the database
951,1,", These copies of the database, all talk to each other"
952,1, What that gives you are a few things
953,1," First of all,  Blockchain gives you better transparency"
954,1,", Let's say you're, using this blockchain for auditing votes, to make sure that there was no double counting of votes or something"
955,1, It becomes instant and trusted
956,1," Second of all, it's more cyber-resilient"
957,1,"! If you want to steal money from a bank today, you don't go in with a gun"
958,1, You go in with a hacker
959,1,", And so $ 84 million was stolen from the Central Bank of Bangladesh by someone hacking into an old version of Microsoft Windows"
960,1," Instead of having that one central database where someone changes a bit and they can steal $ 84 million, they now have to change a thousand copies of that database"
961,1, So it's much much much more difficult to steal money from a bank
962,1," What'S interesting about blockchain, this technology was developed originally by a bunch of people who didn't trust each other very much"
963,1," They definitely did not trust the system, they didn't trust governments or banking institutions, but they trusted the technology"
964,1, We'Ve created a kind of digital trust that now can be used for all sorts of activities in a more cyber resilient and more robust fashion
965,1," It'S interesting you describe it that way, because one hears blockchain being discussed in the context of trust blockchain enables trust"
966,1, And yet you say that it grew out of distrust the lack of trust
967,1, Maybe you can share and enlighten us on that conundrum
968,1,", The original trust model was, if I give my money to the bank, it's safe, because the government stands behind the bank and everything will be okay"
969,1," If you were a customer of Lehman Brothers, you discovered what was wrong with that assumption"
970,1, Set
971,1," Remember: in 2008, during the height of the financial crisis, there were a lot of people who were not just disillusioned with banks, but they were facing the fact, and we still have this problem"
972,1, Today
973,1,", A lot of millennials are underemployed or unemployed, and so they feel the system has failed"
974,1, Them
975,1," They've accumulated all of this debt for college and they can't get a job or they can't get a good job, and so that fosters mistrust in institutions"
976,1,", A bunch of hackers got together, computer programmers and they said `` Hey we're going to create digital trust"
977,1, We'Re going to create something where you don't have to trust any one party
978,1,", You don't have to trust a central banker"
979,1, You don't have to trust the government
980,1, You can trust the network of software and everyone can see what the software does
981,1, So everyone can validate that
982,1, It'S okay
983,1,'' That was the birth of blockchain
984,1," Now today, blockchain is still being used in these"
985,1," What we'd call semi-trustless or completely trustless environments, but it's being used for different purposes, including by mainstream corporations, which I think is a good thing"
986,1," For example, a number of big banks have started setting up new kinds of trading vehicles where different trading partners can trade with each other without revealing proprietary trading strategies"
987,1," Nonetheless, exchange information or transact"
988,1, One of the areas that I'm particularly excited about is around digital identity
989,1," Today, thousands ten thousand financial institutions all over the world duplicate a lot of effort with each other"
990,1, They end up replicating the process of checking your paperwork out to make sure you're okay to do business with
991,1, This drives a lot of cost in the system
992,1, It costs
993,1, As much as $ 130 to onboard a new customer
994,1," Now this creates a lot of exclusion, because if your customer only has an average balance of $ 100, you can't afford to spend $ 130 onboarding them"
995,1,", And so that makes the poorest people not able to do Business with these banks"
996,1," Well, if we created a system where using blockchain as an example, you could stand up these identities and have a system for sharing that information in a trusted fashion and in a distributed fashion, you could dramatically lower the cost by two or three Orders of magnitude"
997,1, Now we can bank the un-bank and that's exciting
998,1, Okay
999,1, Let'S talk about digital trust
1000,1," The first obvious question is: what is digital trust, Digital trust"
1001,1," So what is trust right? Trust is the belief that we can do business together or that, if I say something to you, you can act on it and believe that it'll happen"
1002,1, Digital trust is a way of putting software code around that and saying that the software will make sure that whatever Implied or explicit promise that we make each other is actually going to be followed through on
1003,1,", Then there's the concept of digital identity"
1004,1, What is digital identity and how does that? Link back to the concept of trust? Digital identity is an effort to solve a broken technology problem that we have
1005,1, I mentioned earlier
1006,1, A billion people in the world lack a legal identity in the eyes of government and 3
1007,1,5 billion
1008,1," Have what I'll call imperfect identity attributes, meaning they either don't have a credit history or they have a credit history, but has bad information or for whatever reason, their identity is not matching up with their potential"
1009,1," And so the systems behind how we deal with all this Date back to King Artech Xerxes, I of Persia in 480 BC, where he was giving somebody little clay tablets to use as their passport --, the Prophet Nehemiah"
1010,1, If you're curious
1011,0," We're using technology that goes back to clay tablets and cuneiform, and so we really need to update our technology for identity"
1012,1, The concept of a physical passport is a broken model
1013,1, It can be forged
1014,1,", It can be hacked"
1015,1," The problem people are dealing with in Europe right now is that more than 10 % of Syrian passports are forgeries, and so you want to give humanitarian aid to all these refugees pouring into Europe"
1016,1," And yet, how do you know? Who is who We can use new technology"
1017,1,"? We can use these ubiquitous communication networks, new dig"
